Why I Made This Game                </h2>                <h3>                    I made this game because I felt that it would be a perfect practice for ArrayLists and arrays. This game was also a reasonable choice considering the level of coding that I am at so far. Even though Tic-Tac-Toe is very structured, there were a lot of personal decisions I got to choose while constructing Tic-Tac-Toe such as the user interface and what instructions/decisions I would let the user(s) make.                </h3>                <hr size='3'>                <h2>                    2. What I Learned                </h2>                <h3>                    I learned that it is best to continuously run my code. This will help with debugging and clears up any issues prematurely so that I don't get stuck early on. My teachers and classmates encouraged me along the way to create more classes as it is easier to organize my thinking. They also helped me by thinking out/planning my whole game before I started coding.                </h3>                <hr size='3'>                <h2>                    3. Architecture of My Game                </h2>                <h3>                    There are three main pages to my game: menu, game, and end. These loop over and over by pressing enter until the user wants to close the window. I have five classes: TicTacToe, TicTacToeGamePanel, TicTacToeGameObject, TTTX, and TTTO. TicTacToe is the base of my entire program, it creates the frame and panel, it also has the main method. TicTacToeGamePanel is the class with most of the work as almost everything that the user(s) interact with is the game panel. TicTacToeGameObject is primarily used in TTTX and TTTO because it extends its variables: x, y, width, and height.                 </h3>                <hr size='3'>                <h2>                    4. Technical Implementation                </h2>                <h3>                    The first state, the menu, has 2 features. One when you click enter, which moves to the next state, and one when you click space, which displays the instructions. The second state, the game, has the tic-tac-toe board. To code this, I used 4 thin, black-filled rectangles in order to make them look like lines. Then, I imported X and O icons to use as the pieces that the two players would use. I had to make their width and height 100 by 100 pixels in order for them to fit the spaces that I made for the rectangle. Whichever user, X or O, places 3 in a row, a JOptionPane displays who won! In the last state, the end, the user is prompt with a "Game Over" and "Press ENTER if you want to play again." I modeled these 2 states after LeagueInvaders because I thought it was a good format for a game like tic-tac-toe. I am proud of how I was able to check the winner every time. I was able to use arrays and create 2 different functions that would be looped over every turn.                </h3>                <hr size='3'>                <h2>                    5. Most Challenging Part                </h2>                <h3>                    The most challenging part of this project was checking the winner. There were a few difficulties because I had not coded something like this and also because there were many solutions which made if hard to find the most efficient one. Something that really helped me was that before writing the code, I was able to talk it out with a teacher or think through it by myself. I learned that it is definitely a lot easier if you have a specific plan before you start coding.                </h3>                <hr size='3'>                <h2>                    6. Future Fixes and Updates                </h2>                <h3>                    I don't think there is an error in the game right now, but if I were to continue working on this game, I would try having different levels/modes. For example, I would have another mode for user vs. computer. This would mean that there would not need to be two players on the same computer. This could have different levels. Easy could be that the computer randomly chooses a location on the board while difficult could be that the computer tries to win the game every time. I could also try having 2 computers playing the same game, i.e. user vs. user. This would be a more "professional" setting.                </h3></body>                <hr size='3'>                <footer>                    We are a 501c(3) non-profit programming school.
